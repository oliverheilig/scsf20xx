The purpose of this module is to verify the correct environment setup for the
Reference Implementation to work. The goal is to check for the existence
of the required GlobalBank database.

It is not intended to be part of the RI as it not part of the requirements.
With the correct environment setup this module can be omitted, by
removing its entry from the ProfileCatalog.
